Welcome to the ToxicTypo project!

The ToxicTypo application is a web-based tool that allows users to try out the suggest-lib feature. It is built using Java and SpringBoot and is hosted on AWS.

The application is continuously deployed, meaning that any updates to the master branch of the code are automatically reflected on the live site. The team follows a "feature branches" philosophy, in which developers work on their own branches and make merge requests when their features are complete.

In addition to the suggest-lib feature, the ToxicTypo application also includes end-to-end tests to ensure the quality and functionality of the site. These tests are designed to run quickly, so as not to slow down the development process.

We hope you enjoy using the ToxicTypo application! If you have any feedback or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
